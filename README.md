# Hexproof
A comprehensive library of Magic the Gathering API utilities.

## What is it?
This acts as a submodule for my other project, the [hexproof.io API](https://github.com/Investigamer/hexproof.io).
I intend for this to be a standalone module that other developers can make use of in their own projects, so it will 
be maintained and published separately. This repository is very bare bones at the moment, but the rest of what I 
have built it out is forthcoming so stay tuned.
